# Munro Partners — Style Reference
> Editorial parchment under alpine light — a warm cream canvas holding generous whitespace, a whisper-weight grotesque, and full-bleed mountain photography where the landscape does the talking and the interface stays nearly invisible.

**Theme:** light

Munro Partners operates in a quiet, editorial register: a warm cream canvas (#fff9ee) holds generous whitespace, with every interface element trimmed in a single warm dark brown (#3f322a) that reads as ink rather than black. The Neue Haas Grotesk typography is set tight and small, with a 68px display headline at weight 400 that whispers against full-bleed mountain photography rather than shouting. A single deep teal (#004e4e) is reserved for the most important interactive moments, while muted violets, aubergine, and ice blue appear as thin accent borders on cards and data treatments. The system feels less like a financial product and more like a printed annual report — calm, spacious, and confident enough to let landscape imagery carry the emotional weight.

## Colors

| Name | Value | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Cream Parchment | `#fff9ee` | Page canvas, section backgrounds, card surfaces, nav bar fill — the warm off-white that defines the entire mood and replaces what would normally be pure white |
| Paper White | `#ffffff` | Elevated card surfaces, video embed containers, contrast panels against the cream canvas |
| Bark Brown | `#3f322a` | Primary text, all borders, nav links, body copy, headings — replaces black throughout the system, giving every line a warm ink-like quality |
| Warm Gray | `#9f968c` | Secondary text, subtle borders, nav dividers — the mid-tone that bridges Bark Brown headings and lighter dividers |
| Stone | `#c5bdb3` | Hairline dividers, image borders, subtle separators between sections |
| Driftwood | `#b3aea7` | Input field borders, form element outlines |
| Earth | `#796e65` | Secondary headings, muted label text |
| Light Stone | `#e5e5e5` | Lightest border tone, disabled states, subtle structure lines |
| Ink | `#000000` | Input text color, high-contrast form text — the only context where true black appears |
| Deep Teal | `#004e4e` | Primary action buttons, filled CTAs — the single chromatic fill color permitted for interactive moments, creating quiet authority against the cream |
| Aubergine | `#560e4b` | Decorative card borders, heading accent strokes, editorial highlight containers |
| Iris | `#a56eff` | Decorative card borders, accent strokes on data containers |
| Cobalt | `#3074f9` | Link accents, decorative borders on blue-themed content blocks |
| Ice Blue | `#bfebfe` | Input field backgrounds, soft highlight washes on data rows, subtle surface tint |
| Saffron | `#feed5a` | Occasional button accent for editorial highlight CTAs |
| Amber | `#c67700` | Occasional button accent for warm-themed CTAs |

## Components

### Full-Bleed Hero Image
**Role:** Section opening visual that fills the entire viewport width

Full-bleed landscape photograph (mountains, winding roads, open terrain) spanning 100% viewport width and 60–80vh height. No border-radius. Text overlay sits at bottom-left in white (#ffffff) using display weight 400 at 68px. A large vertical wordmark in white at 100–200px weight 700 anchors the right edge.

### Editorial Wordmark
**Role:** Brand identity mark used as both logo and decorative element

The text 'MUNRO' set in Neue Haas Grotesk Display weight 700, all uppercase, letter-spacing 0.09em. Functions as nav logo at 16px (top-right) and as oversized decorative element at 100–200px (right edge of hero). White on dark photography, Bark Brown (#3f322a) on cream.

### Slim Navigation Bar
**Role:** Persistent top header

Full-width bar on Cream Parchment (#fff9ee) background, 48–56px height. Left: hamburger menu icon + 'MENU' label in Neue Haas Grotesk Text 12px weight 500, letter-spacing 0.018em, color Bark Brown. Right: 'MUNRO' wordmark. No background fill change on scroll, no shadow — the bar is flat and barely visible.

### Filled Teal CTA Button
**Role:** Primary action trigger — the only filled chromatic button in the system

Background Deep Teal (#004e4e), text white, Neue Haas Grotesk Display 12px weight 600, letter-spacing 0.018em, uppercase. Padding 10px vertical, 20px horizontal. Border-radius 2px. No shadow. This is the system sole filled action color — use it for exactly one primary action per view.

### Ghost Text Button
**Role:** Secondary action or link-style trigger

No background, no border. Text only in Bark Brown (#3f322a), Neue Haas Grotesk Display 12px weight 600, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.018em. Padding 10px vertical, 12px horizontal. Underline on hover.

### Section Label
**Role:** Small-caps heading introducing a content block

Neue Haas Grotesk Display 12px weight 700, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.017em, color Bark Brown (#3f322a). No accent line or decorative element — the typography weight and casing does all the work. Examples: 'OUR GLOBAL GROWTH FUNDS'.

### Display Headline
**Role:** Hero or section-opening statement

Neue Haas Grotesk Display 68px weight 400, line-height 1.05, letter-spacing 0.54px. White when overlaid on photography, Bark Brown (#3f322a) on cream. The weight-400 choice is the signature — it whispers rather than shouts, creating authority through restraint.

### Video Embed Card
**Role:** Embedded media container (YouTube, etc.)

16:9 aspect ratio container with Paper White (#ffffff) background, 2px border-radius. Video thumbnail fills the container. Title overlaid top-left in white Neue Haas Grotesk Display 22px weight 400 with a subtitle at 12px. Play button centered.

### Financial Data Table
**Role:** Stacked data rows showing metrics with right-aligned values

Full-width rows separated by 1px Stone (#c5bdb3) hairline borders. Left column: label in Neue Haas Grotesk Display 14px weight 400, color Earth (#796e65). Right column: value in same size, color Bark Brown (#3f322a), right-aligned. No table header, no alternating row colors — pure hairlines and typography do the work.

### Editorial Body Paragraph
**Role:** Long-form descriptive text

Neue Haas Grotesk Display 16px weight 400, line-height 1.41, color Bark Brown (#3f322a) on Cream Parchment (#fff9ee). Max-width 680px for readability. Generous margin-bottom (24–32px) between paragraphs.

### Underlined Input Field
**Role:** Form input — text entry

No visible box, no background fill. Bottom border 1px in Ink (#000000) or Driftwood (#b3aea7). Placeholder text in Warm Gray (#9f968c) at 14px. On focus: bottom border thickens to 2px in Deep Teal (#004e4e). No border-radius — sharp bottom edge only.

### Accent Border Card
**Role:** Content card with thin chromatic border

Cream Parchment (#fff9ee) background, 1px border in a chromatic accent (Aubergine #560e4b, Iris #a56eff, Cobalt #3074f9, or Ice Blue #bfebfe). Border-radius 2px. Padding 20px. No shadow, no fill change. The colored border is the differentiator — multiple cards on a page may use different accent colors.

### Hairline Divider
**Role:** Section separator

1px horizontal line in Stone (#c5bdb3), full container width, 1px height. No margin — sits flush within section spacing rhythm.

### Image Container
**Role:** Photograph or illustration frame

Images sit in containers with 15px border-radius. No border. Full-bleed within container. Used for editorial photography, team portraits, and landscape shots.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Set body text in Neue Haas Grotesk Display 14px/1.43 in Bark Brown (#3f322a) on Cream Parchment (#fff9ee) — never invert this pairing
- Use 2px border-radius for all buttons, badges, inputs, and accent-border cards — the near-square edge is a signature
- Use 15px border-radius exclusively for image containers and decorative links
- Reserve Deep Teal (#004e4e) for the single primary action per view — filled buttons in any other chromatic color are forbidden
- Set display headlines at 68px weight 400 with letter-spacing 0.54px — the whisper-weight is the defining typographic choice
- Separate content blocks with 1px Stone (#c5bdb3) hairlines, not card containers or background fills
- Use full-bleed landscape photography as section heroes with white text overlays — let imagery carry emotional weight
- Set section labels in 12px weight 700 uppercase with letter-spacing 0.017em — the casing and weight do the hierarchy work

### Don't
- Never use #000000 for body text, headings, or borders — Bark Brown (#3f322a) replaces black throughout the system
- Never use pure white (#ffffff) as the page canvas — Cream Parchment (#fff9ee) is the only acceptable base
- Never use border-radius greater than 2px on buttons, badges, or inputs — large radii break the editorial register
- Never stack multiple chromatic accent colors within a single component — one accent per container
- Never use weight 700 for editorial body copy or long-form text — reserve 700 for labels and wordmarks
- Never apply box-shadows or drop-shadows to cards or surfaces — the system is flat, separated only by hairlines
- Never use gradients of any kind — the system is entirely flat color
- Never use #feed5a or #c67700 for primary CTAs — these are one-off editorial accents, not system action colors
- Never set body text larger than 16px or smaller than 14px — the editorial scale stays tight

## Surfaces

- **Cream Parchment** (`#fff9ee`) — Page canvas and section backgrounds — the base warm tone
- **Paper White** (`#ffffff`) — Elevated card and video embed surfaces sitting above the cream
- **Ice Blue Wash** (`#bfebfe`) — Tinted surface for input fields and data row highlights

## Imagery

Full-bleed landscape photography dominates the visual language — Scottish Highland mountains, winding single-lane roads through green valleys, open terrain under overcast skies. Treatment is naturalistic, high-resolution, and unfiltered; no duotone, no color grading overlays, no vignettes. Images are always full-bleed (no rounded corners when used as heroes) but use 15px radius when inset as content images. Photography is the primary visual content; illustration and abstract graphics are absent. Icon style is minimal line icons (hamburger menu visible in nav) with thin strokes. Density is image-heavy at section openings, text-dominant in body sections. The imagery role is emotional atmosphere and brand storytelling — nature as metaphor for long-term investing.

## Layout

Full-bleed hero photography at the top of the page, then a transition to a max-width 1280px centered content area on Cream Parchment. The hero is a full-viewport-width image with overlaid text at bottom-left and a large vertical wordmark at the right edge. Below the hero, content flows in a single editorial column or a two-column split (video left, data table right) with generous vertical spacing (64px between sections). Section rhythm is consistent: hairline divider, then a section label in small-caps, then content. No alternating dark/light bands — the entire body is cream. Navigation is a minimal slim bar at the top with hamburger menu left and wordmark right. Grid usage is minimal — mostly single-column editorial flow with occasional 2-column splits. The overall density is spacious, magazine-like, and unhurried.
